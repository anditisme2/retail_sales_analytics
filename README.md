# RETAIL SALES ANALYSIS

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze real-world e-commerce transaction data to uncover sales trend, customer behaviour, and product performance using SQL and Python. The analysis focuses on sales analytics and RFM (Recency, Frquency, Monetary) based customer segmentation to help businesses improve retention, optimize marketing strategies, and drive revenue growth.\
The project has been designed as an end-to-end data analytics case study, covering data modeling, querying, exploratory data analysis, segmentation, and visualization.\

## Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often struggle with:\
• Identification of high-value customers\
• Understanding repeat purchase behaviour\
• Prevent customer churn\
This project addresses these challenges by answering through analysis:\
• Who are the most valuable customers?\
• Which customer segments offer highest growth potential?\
• How does revenue vary across time, products, and customer behaviour?\

## Technology Stack
• Python: Pandas, NumPy\
• SQL: Data modeling, analytics queries\
• Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn\
• Environment: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook\
• Version Control: Git and GitHub\

## Dataset
Brazillian E-commerce Dataset by Olist (Size: ~100k orders)\
Tables Used:
• customers\
• orders\
• order_items\
• payments\
• products\

## Data Modeling
A relational schema was designed using SQLite with proper primary and foreign key relationships to support analytical queries.\
Key relationships:\
• customers -> orders\
• orders -> order_items\
• orders -> payments\
• products -> order_items\

## Key analyses
• Sales and Revenue Analysis\
(Total revenue and total orders, Revenue trends over time, Revenue by product category, and by payment type)\
• Customer Behaviour Analysis\
(Repeat customer percentage, order frequency per customer, average order value)\

## Insights
1. Champions
• Have the highest average monetary value\
• Purchase relatively recently and frequently, showing high engagement\
• Represent a small but highly valuable customer segment driving the largest share of revenue\
2. Potential Loyalists
• The largest customer segment, contributing significantly to total revenue due to sheer volume\
• Show moderate-to-high-spending but lower frequency than Champions\
• Exhibit strong potential to transition into high-value customers\
3. At Risk
• Generated meaningful revenue in the past but have been inactive recently (high recency values)\
• Show declining purchase frequency\
• Represent a critical churn-risk segment where revenue loss is likely\
4. Low Value
• Have the lowest average monetary value among all segments\
• Show low frequency and low spend, indicating minimal engagement\
• Contribute marginally to overall revenue and show limited growth potential\

## Recommendations
• Champions: Focus on retention, loyalty rewards, and personalized experiences\
• Potential Loyalists: Convert into Champions through targeted engagement and incentives\
• At Risk: Implement win-back campaigns to reduce churn\
• Low Value: Use cost-efficient engagement strategies\

## Conclusion
Business insights can be generated by combining SQL driven analytics with Python-based EDA and visualization.\

## Future Enhancements
• Churn prediction using machine learning\
• Advanced customer clustering techniques
